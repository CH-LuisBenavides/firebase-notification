# Implementing Firebase Push Notifications with Spring Boot

## General Overview
The implementation of push notifications using Firebase and Spring Boot requires the integration of Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for sending messages, handling FCM tokens, associating tokens with users in your database, and ensuring secure and scalable operations. This document outlines the step-by-step process required to achieve this.

## Steps to Accomplish the Task

### Step 1: Setting Up Firebase
- **Tasks**:
    - Create a Firebase project in the Firebase Console.
    - Enable Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) service.
    - Generate a Firebase Service Account Key.
    - Download the service account JSON file securely (used in the backend).

- **Considerations**:
    - Ensure you have appropriate permissions in the Firebase Console for project creation.
    - Service account keys should not be exposed in source control.

---

### Step 2: Adding Firebase Support in Spring Boot
- **Tasks**:
    - Add dependencies for Firebase Admin SDK in the `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.
    - Place the Firebase service account key in your application.
    - Configure Firebase in a Spring Boot `@Configuration`-annotated class for application-wide initialization.
    - Set up properties or environmental variables for sensitive configurations such as Firebase credentials.

- **Considerations**:
    - Ensure the Firebase initialization is done during Spring Boot’s application startup phase.
    - Validate that the integration functions as expected before proceeding further.

---

### Step 3: Managing FCM Tokens
- **Tasks**:
    - Design a schema to store FCM tokens in the database, mapping them to users in the system (user-table > token-table relationship).
        - Each token entry will include attributes like:
            - Token (unique FCM token for the device).
            - Associated user ID.
            - Device details or metadata.
            - Expiry timestamps.
    - Create a REST API endpoint to allow the client to send its FCM token during login or app startup.
    - Implement logic to save tokens to the database or update them if they already exist for a user and device.

- **Considerations**:
    - Once tokens are stored, additional operations like token management, validation, and cleanup should also be implemented.
    - Handle database updates and FCM token uniqueness constraints carefully, especially for users with multiple devices.

---

### Step 4: Sending Notifications
- **Tasks**:
    - Create a service in the backend responsible for sending notifications to users based on their FCM tokens.
    - Use the Firebase Admin SDK to build and send FCM messages (single device or to multiple devices in batch).
    - Implement customizable notification payloads for use cases like:
        - Text notifications.
        - Data-only notifications (useful for client-side logic handling).
    - Optionally, allow notifications to be sent to user groups or topics.

- **Considerations**:
    - Ensure the message-forming logic is flexible enough to handle various use cases.
    - For batch notifications, FCM has limits on the number of tokens per request; scale accordingly.

---

### Step 5: Handling Notifications on the Client-Side
- **Tasks**:
    - The client (e.g., mobile app, web app) must integrate the Firebase SDK to:
        - Retrieve FCM tokens upon app launch or login.
        - Handle received push notifications, whether displayed directly to users or processed silently.
        - Send the token to your Spring Boot backend using the `/register-token` endpoint.

- **Considerations**:
    - The client must refresh the FCM token if it changes (e.g., during app reinstallation) and notify the backend for updates.
    - Ensure consistent implementation across all platforms using FCM (e.g., Android, iOS, or web).

---

### Step 6: Security and Token Validation
- **Tasks**:
    - Validate the received FCM token before associating it with the user in the backend. Ensure that:
        - Tokens belong to authenticated users.
        - Only valid tokens are stored (e.g., handle expired tokens or duplicates).
    - Protect the REST APIs for storing and sending notifications using authentication/authorization mechanisms (JWT, OAuth2, etc.).
    - Secure sensitive data like tokens in the database (e.g., using encryption).

- **Considerations**:
    - Always encrypt sensitive Firebase keys and FCM tokens.
    - Use role-based access control (RBAC) for any exposed notification APIs.

---

### Step 7: Notification Scheduling and Targeting
- **Tasks**:
    - Build systems for targeted notifications, such as filtering based on user preferences or behavior.
    - Implement a scheduling pipeline for sending notifications at specific times:
        - Periodic delivery or recurring events.
        - Time zones handling for users globally.
    - Group notifications via Firebase topics for easier broadcasting to groups of users (e.g., promotional messages).

- **Considerations**:
    - Use queues or scheduling systems (like Quartz or Spring Tasks) for large-scale or delayed notifications.
    - Use Firebase topics sparingly and maintain a hierarchy if needed for complex user targeting.

---

### Step 8: Token Management and Cleanup
- **Tasks**:
    - Regularly validate stored tokens by replacing invalid/expired tokens with fresh ones from the client.
    - Periodically clear out tokens belonging to users who are no longer active or have opted out of notifications.

- **Considerations**:
    - Use Firebase’s API to validate tokens, ensuring your database only contains active tokens.
    - Establish a cleanup policy to prevent database bloat and reduce potential performance issues.

---

### Step 9: Monitoring and Troubleshooting
- **Tasks**:
    - Set up monitoring tools for tracking notification delivery rates and failures:
        - Use Firebase’s built-in analytics and failure reports.
        - Log and analyze notification errors to identify issues like expired tokens, incorrect payloads, etc.
    - Implement retry logic for failed notifications to eligible recipients.

- **Considerations**:
    - Firebase provides limited delivery analytics; integrate external monitoring tools if needed.
    - Continuously refine the notification system based on its performance and logs.

---

## High-Level Flow

1. **Login/Startup**:
    - Client retrieves the FCM token from the device and sends it to the backend.
    - Backend associates the token with the user in the database.

2. **Send Notification**:
    - Backend identifies the recipient(s) based on user preferences, behavior, or admin commands.
    - Send a notification to the user(s) using their FCM tokens.

3. **Client Handling**:
    - Client receives the notification and processes it (e.g., displays it to the user).

4. **Validation and Cleanup**:
    - Backend periodically checks token validity and removes expired or unused tokens.
